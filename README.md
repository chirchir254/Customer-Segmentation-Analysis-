# Customer Segmentation Analysis 

## Project overview 
The customer segmentation project aims to identify distinct customer groups to enhance targeted marketing strategies. By leveraging clustering techniques on customer data, the project will uncover patterns and behaviors, enabling personalized marketing campaigns, improved customer satisfaction, and increased revenue. This data-driven approach will provide insights into customer preferences, purchasing habits, and demographic characteristics, facilitating more effective and efficient business decision-making.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes an e-commerce dataset from Kaggle, containing customer purchase history, demographics, and behavioral data, providing a comprehensive foundation for effective customer segmentation analysis.

## Tools
- python
  
## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing

## EDA

Cluster	Customer Attributes
0	Customers in this segment have low recency, frequency, and monetary value scores. These are people who make occasional purchases and are likely to visit the platform only when they have a specific product they’d like to buy.
1	These customers are seen making purchases often and have visited the platform recently. Their monetary value is extremely high, indicating that they spend a lot when shopping online. This could mean that users in this segment are likely to make multiple purchases in a single order and are highly responsive to cross-selling and up-selling. Resellers who purchase products in bulk could also be part of this segment.
2	Customers in this segment have been seen making purchases very frequently in the past. However, these are people who have stopped visiting the platform for some reason and haven’t been seen shopping on the site recently. This could mean several things — they were disappointed with the service and switched to a competitor platform, they no longer have any interest in the products sold, or their customer ID changed as they re-registered onto the platform with different credentials.
3	This cluster consists of users who are new to the platform. They have the potential to become long-term consumers with high frequency and monetary value and should be targeted with special “new-user promotions” to instill brand loyalty.
